# No-op

This block type performs no operations. It can be useful for testing or as a template for other implementations.

## Block Manifest

The `kblock.yaml` file defines the block manifest, containing block definitions like names, icons, description and optional operator environment settings.

## Input Schema

The input schema is defined in `src/values.schema.json`.

## Implementation

The engine is set to `noop` so no operations are performed.

## Outputs

No outputs are defined.
