# Kblocks

Kblocks is a tool for creating platform building blocks using any IAC engine or Helm charts and
packaging them as Kubernetes custom resources.

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

- node
- docker
- kind
- kubectl
- helm

## Installation

Install the CLI:

```sh
npm i -g @kblocks/cli
```

Verify installation:

```sh
kb --version
0.223.0
```

## Creating new blocks

The `kb init` command can be used to create a new block project from a variety of project types.

To view the list of possible project types, run:

```sh
kb init --help

...

custom: Block implemented using custom hooks for "create", "update" and "delete"

helm: Helm is an open-source package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to
define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that
provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud providers.

tofu: OpenTofu is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that
enables you to manage your infrastructure as code.

wing-k8s: Winglang is an open-source programming language that enables you to
build cloud applications.
```

After you create a block project, check out it's **README** file. It will include detailed
information on how to define and implement your block, based on the underlying engine.

## Building and installing your block to a cluster

The following command will build a Helm chart for your block:

```sh
kb build
```

The chart will go under `dist/` and can be installed using Helm.

You can also use this command to build and install/upgrade:

```sh
kb install
```

## Creating resources

Once a block is installed to your cluster, it becomes a native Kubernetes resource and can be used
from the Kubernetes control plane. For example, you can apply it using `kubectl apply`, put it in
Helm charts, view it in [k9s](https://k9scli.io/), etc.

## Development

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/winglang/kblocks.git
cd kblocks
```

Install deps:

```sh
npm i
```

1. You'll nee a Kubernetes cluster, you can get one from [quickube](https://quickube.sh):

```sh
qkube new --size small
```

2. Build & Deploy to the Cluster

> We have a [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) setup.

```sh
npm run dev
```

3. Add test resources

Use `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f test/examples/
```

4. Monitor logs

`npm run dev` will tail logs and you should be able to see how these resources are deployed.

## Advanced Topics

An output can be referenced from another kblock through the syntax:

```
ref://queues.acme.com/my-queue/queueUrl
```

If the worker encounters this token when reconciling a resource, it will first wait for the
referenced resource to be ready and then it will read the value from it's state and replace it in
the manifest being reconciled.
