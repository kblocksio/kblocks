# Kblocks

Kblocks is a tool for creating Kubernetes [custom
resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources
(CRDs) operators backed by Terraform configurations or Helm charts. In the future, Kblocks will also
support CloudFormation/CDK, Pulumi and other IaC engines.

Kblocks is ideal for allowing platform engineering teams to vend standard components to application
teams which codify security, compliance and operational best practices and expose them as native
Kubernetes resources.

Let's say I want to create a CRD that represents an Amazon SQS queue and implement it using a
Terraform configuration. All I need to do is:

1. Define the CRD schema
2. Write the Terraform configuration

Then, I can run `kb build` and Kblocks will produce a self-contained Helm package that can be rolled
out to any Kubernetes cluster and includes the CRD and a Kubernetes operator that manages the
lifecycle of these SQS queue resources.

Kblocks is shipped with a CLI tool (called `kb`) which can be used to create, build and deploy
blocks into Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

The CLI requires the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker
- kubectl
- Helm
- Terraform

## Installation

Install the CLI:

```sh
npm i -g @kblocks/cli
```

Verify installation:

```sh
kb --version
0.5.32
```

## CLI Reference

### `kb init`

The `kb init` command can be used to create a new block project from a variety of project templates.

To view the list of possible project templates, run:

```sh
kb init --help
Supported project templates:

custom: Block implemented using custom hooks for "create", "update" and "delete"

helm: Helm is an open-source package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to
define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that
provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud providers.

tofu: OpenTofu is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that
enables you to manage your infrastructure as code.

wing-k8s: Winglang is an open-source programming language that enables you to
build cloud applications.
```

After you create a project, check out it's **README** file. It will include detailed information on
how to define and implement your block, based on the underlying engine.

### `kb build`

The following command will build a Helm chart for your block:

```sh
kb build
```

The chart will go under `dist/` and can be installed using Helm.

### `kb install`

You can also use this command to build and install/upgrade:

```sh
kb install
```

## Contributing

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/winglang/kblocks.git
cd kblocks
```

Install deps:

```sh
npm i
```

1. You'll nee a Kubernetes cluster, you can get one from [quickube](https://quickube.sh):

```sh
qkube new --size small
```

2. Build & Deploy to the Cluster

> We have a [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) setup.

```sh
npm run dev
```

3. Add test resources

Use `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f test/examples/
```

4. Monitor logs

`npm run dev` will tail logs and you should be able to see how these resources are deployed.

## Advanced Topics

An output can be referenced from another kblock through the syntax:

```
ref://queues.acme.com/my-queue/queueUrl
```

If the worker encounters this token when reconciling a resource, it will first wait for the
referenced resource to be ready and then it will read the value from it's state and replace it in
the manifest being reconciled.
