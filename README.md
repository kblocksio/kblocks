# Kblocks

Kblocks is a tool for creating Kubernetes [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources)
(CRDs) operators backed by Terraform configurations or Helm charts. In the future, Kblocks will also
support CloudFormation/CDK, Pulumi and other IaC engines.

Kblocks is ideal for allowing platform engineering teams to vend standard components to application
teams which codify security, compliance and operational best practices and expose them as native
Kubernetes resources.
